# Logging in

Once you have received your user account information, you can login to Cradle using your credentials from a terminal/command line prompt.

To get started, you will use `ssh` to login with the following:

*For all of the below. replace `username` with your username

```
$ ssh username@login.cradle.utrgv.edu
```

From here, you will be prompted to input your password with a prompt:

```shell
username@login.cradle.utrgv.edu's password: 
```

Once you enter your password successfully you will see your command prompt display that you are currently working in the cluster with the following:

```shell
[username@login001 ~]$
```

You are now ready to work!
